# Learning Adversarial Bidding Strategies 

distributions : contains classes allowing to generate samples from probabilistic distributions.

regretNet_GPU : pytorch implementation of all networks from D. Parkes' "Optimal Auctions through Deep Learning" paper

regret_Net_adversarial : code learning optimal shading for regretNet neural networks

run_expes_gpu : experiments to check reproducibility is achieved
